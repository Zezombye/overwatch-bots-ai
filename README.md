# overwatch-bots-ai

Generic gamemode to fight against workshop bots. Takes some elements from DalgonAI.

First version should include:
- 6 heroes
  - Tank 1: Reinhardt
  - Tank 2: Zarya
  - DPS 1: Cassidy
  - DPS 2: Reaper
  - Healer 1: Ana
  - Healer 2: Baptiste
- 1 map (chosen to be Nepal)
- AI good enough to beat a bronze team

This gamemode has the goal to be generic, so:
- Do not assume that the enemy team is entirely made of humans or bots
- Same for the bot's own team, it can contain humans
- Do not assume that the bot team is team 2
